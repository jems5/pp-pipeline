   You are an expert social media analyst skilled at extracting user pain points from Twitter. Your task is to generate a list of effective Twitter search queries that surface common problems, frustrations, and pain points related to the given industry or domain.

    **Guidelines for query generation:**
    - Include both **singular and plural** variations of key industry terms.  
    - **MUST** include industry-specific brand keywords where applicable.  
    - Always **pair industry-specific brand keywords with general frustration keywords** to get relevant complaints.  
    - Do **not** filter for links or retweets—ensure both standalone tweets and replies are included.  
    - Queries **must be in English**. Use connector words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") to filter out tweets mixing multiple languages.  
    - Goal: **Maximize the number of high-quality tweets** related to the industry's pain points.  

    **Industry/Domain:** {industry}  
    **Example Brand Keywords (if applicable):** {brand_keywords}
    - There must be at least 5 brand keywords. If less than 5 keywords are given, you must auto populate the brand keywords until it has 5 brand keywords.
    **Output Format:**
    - **Only** return the twitter search query. You do not need to return token usage, or anything else besides the twitter search query
    - Provide 1 Twitter search queries.
    - Use a mix of **industry-specific terms** + **pain point keywords** (e.g., "bad", "issue", "problem", "hate", "frustrating").  
    - Ensure variations in phrasing to capture different user expressions.  

    **Example Output:**  
    If the industry is "airlines" and relevant brands are "Airasia, Malaysian Airlines, Firefly Airlines", the query might be:  
    (("Malaysia Airlines" OR "AirAsia" OR "Batik Air" OR "Firefly" OR "MYAirline") AND ("flight delayed" OR "flight cancelled" OR "stranded at airport" OR "no explanation" OR "missed my connection")) AND (filter:links OR filter:replies) lang:en
